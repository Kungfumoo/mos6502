--TODO--
-Output, add console output
   - Need to work out how this works, do peripherals look at specific areas
     of memory? Or registers?
-Memory Leaking:
    -Before hitting the compiler, sort out the memory leaks in the application.
    -Use valgrind, I've added a file called 'val' which is a script for this, pop it in debug where the exe is and run it to check for leaks.
    -http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html#quick-start.mcrun

-Compiler
    -Need to implement constant definitons and support the JMP command

-Some methods such as INX, depending on the state of x, will only set one status bit and not reset the other.
 Need to check whether this needs to be the case(most likely).
    -If it is, need to go through the code and change it to reflect this.
